to use lppo libraries you would use at the beginning
use "LPPO.libname"
here are all of the lppo libraries
use "LPPO.php"
use "LPPO.cookie"
use "LPPO.index"
use "LPPO.stat"
use "LPPO.forms"
use "LPPO.requests"
use "LPPO.asm(UNEF)"
use "LPPO.LAN"
use "LPPO.WAN"
use "LPPO.conf"
use "LPPO.lang.C"
use "LPPO.lang.C#"
use "LPPO.lang.CPP"
use "LPPO.lang.rust"
use "LPPO.lang.python"
use "LPPO.lang.javascript"
use "LPPO.lang.HTML"
use "LPPO.lang.typescript"
use "LPPO.lang.CSS"
use "LPPO.lang.tailwind"
use "LPPO.lang.reactJS"
or if you would like to use all lppo libs you can use (may cause instability so not recommended)
use "LPPO.*
if you would like to import all lppo lang libs you can use (should not cause instability)
use "LPPO.lang.*"

to define a main function in lppo you would use

public @ class (lppo.libname) { ## modify libname to the actual lib ##
    // code here
}

comments are not automatically installed within lppo so you must define them (reference in comments.txt)

to define a function within the main function you would use (assuming comments are ## comment here ##)

public @ class (lppo.libname) { ## modify libname to the actual lib ##
    from (LPPO.libname.libfunc); ## you can use multiple lib imports into the main function with "and" ##

    use pre-imports(LPPO.libname);
        private class @ void (lib_func): ## this line defines the function in the main function ##
        // code here

}
