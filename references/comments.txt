comments are not pre-defined in lppo so an example to define comments as ## comment here ##
you would use

example.lppo

use "LPPO.conf" ## needed for modifying lppo config ##

public @ class (LPPO.conf.Comments) {
    from (LPPO.conf.Mod) and (LPPO.conf.Set);

    use pre-imports(LPPO.conf) amd (LPPO.conf.Mod) and (LPPO.conf.Set):
        private class @ void (get_conf)
            using "LPPO.conf" (
                get
                    using "LPPO.conf" (
                        use GET{pullfrom"conf.comments"=define[comments]};
                    )
        private class @ void (mod_conf)
            using "LPPO.conf" (
                mod
                    using "LPPO.conf" (
                        from "conf.comments"=define[comments];
                        mod "conf.comments"=define["##%a%##];
                    )
            )
        )
}

endl;

now in line 23 where you see 
    mod "conf.comments"=define["##%a%##];
means that the comments look like ## comments here ##
the %a% in the center is what is to be contained in the comments
